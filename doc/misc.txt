I'm not sure whether this "Walker" class is such a good idea.
It was intended as a starting point and have the responsibility of getting links of articles within the article.

But as it is designed now, there would be one global Walker for the program (since the walker holds th article collection).
But a walker would also need to walk through other articles recursively...

Thus, it might not be such a good idea...
